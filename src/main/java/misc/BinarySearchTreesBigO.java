    // binary search trees are more efficient when using lookup() and remove() because of O(log n)
    // linked lists are not because youd have to iterate through all indexes or reindex items in the list
    // comparisons apply to array lists as well
    // linked lists and binary search trees are both dynamic sized data structures


    // in an unsorted array list if you add an item to the end its just O(1) so its better than a binary search tree
    // but if you were looking up or removing by value, not by index, it would be O(n)
