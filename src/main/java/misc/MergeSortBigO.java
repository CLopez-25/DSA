/*

    Merge sort is as efficient as you can make a sorting algorithm because
    it breaks everything down into single item arrays.

    the space complexity is O(n). in the example you have 8 items in the array and then
    you had to create 8 new items.

    breaking the example apart and iterating thru the array is O(log n)-
    and putting it back together would be O(n), which gives us O(n log n).
    when it comes to sorting algorithms O(n^2) and O(n log n) are pretty much your two options.
        (there are some exceptions to this with sorting only numbers because
        there are some efficiencies when sorting only numbers.)
