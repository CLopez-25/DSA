/*
    from a space complexity perspective when we run a pivot this is O(1).
    this is an advantage of quick sort over mere sort.

    from a time complexity it is O(n) because we had a
    for loop that went from the beginning to the end,
    and if you look at how many times we had to do it, it was three. that's O(log n)
    so what you end up with is O(n log n), which is better than O(n^2). but that is actually the best case.
    the worst case is if you have already sorted data!
        remember big o looks at worst case
